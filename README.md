# Hangman:Assembly

## Introduction

**Hangman:Assembly** is a unique twist on the classic Hangman game, built using **React**. Instead of drawing a stick figure, your incorrect guesses slowly wipe out your developer "health bar" â€” represented by popular programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

Guess the word correctly, and you preserve your developer skills. Fail... and it's time to start learning **Assembly** â€” the most brutal endgame of all!

## How It Works

- The game picks a random secret word.
- Each incorrect guess eliminates one programming language from your "health bar".
- The languages act as your lives: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.
- Once all the languages are wiped out, you lose â€” and receive a message encouraging you to start learning Assembly.
- Guess all the letters before losing all languages, and you win the game!
